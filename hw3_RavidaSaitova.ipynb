In order to be able to do that, a good spell-checking mechanism should be incorporated into a search procedure. Today we will take one step further towards building a good search engine and work on tolerant retrieval with respect to user queries. We will consider two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users know that they don't know the correct spelling OR they want to get the results that follow some known pattern, so the use so called wildcards - queries like `retr*val`;\n",
    "2. Users don't know the correct spelling OR they don't care OR they are in a rush OR they expect that mistakes will be corrected OR /your option/... so they make mistakes and we need to handle them using:\n",

    "We will handle wildcard queries using k-grams. K-gram is a list of consecutive k chars in a string - i.e., for the word *'star'*, it will be '*\\$st*', '*sta*', '*tar*', and '*ar$*', if we take k=3. Take a look at [book](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf) *chapter 3.2.2* to understand how k-grams can help efficiently match a wildcard against dictionary words. Here we will only consider wildcards with star symbols (may be multiple).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that for building k-grams index, **we will need a vocabulary of original word forms** to compare words in user input to the vocabulary of \"correct\" words (think why inverted index which we built for stemmed words doesn't work here).   \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `build_inverted_index_orig_forms` - creates inverted index of original world forms from `facts` list, which is already given to you.  \n",
    "    Output format: `term:[collection_frequency, (doc_id_1, doc_freq_1), (doc_id_2, doc_freq_2), ...]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- `build_k_gram_index` - creates k-gram index which maps every k-gram encountered in facts collection to a list of words containing this k-gram. Use the abovementioned inverted index of original words to construct this index.  \n",
    "    Output format: `'k_gram': ['word1_with_k_gram', 'word2_with_k_gram', ...]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- `generate_wildcard_options` - produce a list of vocabulary words matching given wildcard by intersecting postings of k-grams present in the wildcard (refer to *ch 3.2.2*). \n",
    "\n",
    "- `search_wildcard` - return list of facts that contain the words matching a wildcard query.\n",
